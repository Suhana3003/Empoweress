        <div class="content-body">
            <div class="content-text paragraphs">Sexual disorderoccurs when you have a problem that prevents you from wanting or enjoying sexual activity. Sexual disorder is different from asexuality. It can happen anytime. People of all ages experience sexual disorders although the chances increase as you age.<br>
<br>
Four categories of sexual dysfunction exist. It’s normal not to be in the mood sometimes. None of these should be considered a disorder unless it happens regularly and significantly affects your sexual life:<br>
<ul class="sex-list">
    <li>Desire disorder is when you have little or no interest in sexual relations on an ongoing basis.</li>
    <li>Arousal disorder means you’re emotionally in the mood, but your body isn’t into it.</li>
    <li>Orgasm disorder means you’re emotionally in the mood, but you have an inability to climax that leaves you frustrated.</li>
    <li>Pain disorder involves having pain during intercourse.</li>
</ul>

        <div class="causes-question question borderline">What <span> causes </span>sexual disorders?</div>
        <div class="causes-body paragraphs ">Stress is a common cause of sexual dysfunction. Other causes include:<br>
            <ul class="sex-list">
                <li>sexual trauma</li>
                <li>psychological issues</li>
                <li>diabetes</li>
                <li>heart disease or other medical conditions</li>
                <li>drug use</li>
                <li>alcohol use</li>

    <div class="cure">
        <div class="cure-question question borderline">How are sexual disorders <span>treated?</span></div>
        <div class="cure-body paragraphs ">Psychological counseling may help. A therapist can teach you how to cope with stress and anxiety. Joint counseling with your partner can help improve communication and increase intimacy.<br><br>

Sometimes, support and education about sexual behavior are all that you need. You can address body image and other inhibitions in counseling. For deeply rooted sexual dysfunction, psychotherapy may be necessary.<br><br>

Often, the longer a sexual dysfunction goes on, the more your level of stress and anxiety rises. This can perpetuate the problem. Most of the time, the outlook for people with sexual dysfunction is quite good. However, some medical conditions make it more difficult to overcome.<br>

You can reverse sexual dysfunction due to stress or temporary circumstances if you approach them openly. Deep-seated psychological issues may take longer to manage or may never fully resolve, but you can improve them.</div>
